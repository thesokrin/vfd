# Atlas Development Environment

## Load Balancing Resources

An Atlas Project for public, WAN-facing elastic load balancer resources in the DMZ Atlas Layer.

### Scripts

A sample script called `generate-listeners.rb` exists in the `scripts/` directory in this project. This script generates
one hundred listener blocks for the Chat Sieve load balancer because these listeners must be created by hand.
